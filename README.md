# PluralSIGHT


It’s better to use a list
Because you cannot ad to an already set array
If you have 8 spaces and only 4 are filled with data the rest will be null
If you call the size with 3 values but 8 spaces
And you try to get the size you will always return 8 even though 5 of those three spaces are empty


Types are inferred
Maps use .put() to add keys and values
Uses containsKey returns true or false
.get() to

Put comparison operator first


.entrySet() returns a set of the key/value entries used for iterating

Hashmap - no particular order
Linked map order they were entered
Tree map alpha numerically lexiocligraphical


Sets don’t allow repeated values
.RetainAll() gets intersection
